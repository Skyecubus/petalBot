this is the first iteration of Petal bot

some of the commands include regex sentence parsing for yay!, oh no, and good floret!

there are also commands such as !hello, !ping, !gay, !trans rights, and !trans wrongs

petal bot will also respond with("100!") if 100 messages have been sent in a server that it is apart of 
(warning! bug: currently will count up no matter what server need to fix it to keep count local to the specific server)
